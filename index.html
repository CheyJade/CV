    <h3>Equestrian Experience</h3>
    <p>I have been riding since I was 7 years old and have been incredibly lucky with the level of support I have been given throughout my riding career.
        <br>My most notable wins to date are the PR Open Show Jumping Champs, JR Open Show Jumping Champs and the Philip Smith Memorial Equitation Championship. 
        <br>I am currently work riding for Emerald Isle Styd and have been given the ride on some of their superstar show jumpers.
        <br>Over the next year I plan to establish myself further in the open classes and hopefully by the end of the year I am comfortable in the 1.40m classes
        <br>so that I can get into some Grand Prix classes next year. I am so excited and grateful to be a part of the Tack 'n Togs team this year and I am
        <br>looking forward to a successful year ahead.
