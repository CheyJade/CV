    <h1>Studies and Experience</h1>
    <h3>Studies</h3>
    <p>I am currently in my third year studying a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science specialising in Virtual Reality and Games Development. 
        <br>I am working towards graduating with honours and hope to further my education with a Masters of Science specialising in Cyber Security. 
        <br>Furthermore, I am currently taking a couple of courses to further my knowledge on programming and the various languages used for different
        <br>projects. I thoroughly enjoy working and programming in Python and am working towards completing 100 Python projects over 100 Days. I hope to
        <br>broaden my skill set as much as possible over the coming months so that I am well rounded and am able to complete various projects when and where needed.
        <br>Below are my current skills. I hope to add to this collection in the coming months.
